# DearPyGui manages the application window (i.e. viewport) using
# the Win32 API (on Windows only of course). This module contains
# functions that change a particular attribute value that causes
# a specific color (RGB) to not be painted (effectively making it 
# "transparent"), reverse the effects of that change. There is also
# a "convenience" function that makes this process pretty effortless.
# It should work for Windows 8.1, 10, and 11.
#
# This is provided for use as-is. I've tested this pretty
# thoroughly without issues (excluding ones mentioned above), but
# that does not mean the issues do not exist. Consider this a disclaimer
# for "if something goes wrong, it ain't on me." Please read the callable's
# docstrings and comments before use as they contain some useful info.
#
# If you aren't one for semantics and just want your transparent viewport, the
# function you want is `toggle_dpg_viewport_transparency`.
